# Terraform AWS ECS Cluster with ALB

This Terraform project sets up an AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) cluster integrated with an ALB (Application Load Balancer) to deploy containerized applications. It automates the creation of necessary resources such as VPC, subnets, security groups, ECS cluster, ECS service, ALB, and related configurations using Infrastructure-as-Code principles.
